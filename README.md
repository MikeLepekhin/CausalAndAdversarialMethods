## Description

This repository contains the code for reproducing the experiments for the paper Causal Models and Adversarial Training: Selecting the right properties
for robust non-topical text classification.

It contains two sections: 

1) experiments with the adversarial methods,

2) experiments with CausaLM.

For CausaLM, we partly use code from the following repo: https://github.com/amirfeder/CausaLM

In this repo, we apply approaches described in the following papers:
